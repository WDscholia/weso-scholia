## Done
- Tested Continent aspect. Works, but Europe, NA, Asia and Africa crash out of memory as heap size overcomes 4 GB. Locations-as-topics is unbearably large at such scales.
- Now non-cached countries search for their data in wikidata. In case you try to get a Q that is not a country the animations end and the tables are shown empty.

## Tasks
- Research about compress country data.
